# WebGL workshop in Milan, June 2015
Hi,
this is the official repository for the [3DWeb Workshop](http://www.3dweb.cc/)

# What you need to follow these tutorials
Some prerequisites required to understand the tutorials:
+   only a basic understanding of coding / JavaScript
+   zero 3D graphicâ€™s background required
+   basic knowledge of HTML and web stack
+   some examples require a simple HTTP server running, due to [CORS policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy): 
if you don't already have one, we suggest you to use [Python's SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)
which comes in bundle with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and is already installed on various Linux distributions and OS/X and has an installer for Windows.
