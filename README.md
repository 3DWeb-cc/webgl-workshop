# WebGL workshop in Milan, June 2015
Hi,
this is the official repository for the [3DWeb Workshop](http://www.3dweb.cc/) 

# What you need to follow these tutorials
Some prerequisites required to understand the tutorials:
+   only a basic understanding of coding / JavaScript
+   zero 3D graphicâ€™s background required
+   basic knowledge of HTML and web stack

# Workhop schedule
##Saturday, June 6th - getting started!
+   Theory #1: what is 3D computer graphic
+   Theory #2: working with real world complexity
+   [Create a bare scene](course_material/01_create_scene.md)
+   [Let the renderer run](course_material/02_run_scene.md)
+   [Creating geometry with primitives](course_material/03_create_geometry.md)
+   [Adding lights](course_material/04_adding_lights.md)
+   [Use transformations (translate, rotate, scale) with 3D objects](course_material/05_use_transformations.md)
+   [Make an interactive scene with OrbitControls](course_material/06_user_interaction.md)
+   [Grouping objects: the scene graph](course_material/07_grouping_objects.md)

## Saturday, June 13th - working with materials!
+   Brief recap about Workshop #1
+   Theory: materials and textures
+   Load custom geometry using COLLADA file format
+   Modifying custom geometries iterating the scene graph
+   Change material's color using _diffuse_ property
+   Make transparent materials with _opacity_
+   Load custom textures and apply them to the materials
+   Texture mapping: how should I apply the "wallpaper"?
+   Give a real environment to your scene with environment maps
+   Just a "wallpaper"? How to control different properties through textures
+   Add real reflections to materials with the CubeCamera
+   Create a realistic glass material with refraction

## Saturday, June 20th - user interaction
+   Again on user interaction: how to translate mouse coordinates from the page to the 3D world
+   Find objects which are being traversed from the pointer
