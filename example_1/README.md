#What we need
A webgl renderer, a scene to render... and one camera: it will be our eye into the 3D world.
Then we can provide something to render, let's say one simply cube.
But what is a cube for our browser? We need to make an object using geometrical data (vertices, faces) and a material which will tell the renderer how to show our geometry.
Wait... still nothing.
Of course, even in the real world you won't see a concrete cube in your room without turning on the light!

Let's learn the first 3D basic concepts playing with light, color and material.
